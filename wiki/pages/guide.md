Guide to the Carnivore Diet by Travis Statham


The Carnivore Diet is bigger than ever, and the recent exposure in the news and on social media has propelled its trajectory into the stratosphere. I'll walk you through the history and basic knowledge, then my views on how to actually do the diet, and then give you some ways to find more information and make your own decisions. 

The basic Carnivore Diet has been talked about for centuries - but in this story - we can start with The Bear - Stanley Owsley, who traveled with the Grateful Dead - and did the Carnivore Diet for 53 years before his untimely death in a car accident. He wrote various forum posts on it that led to the creation of a zerocarb forum. That eventually led to a Facebook group called Zeroing in on Health, followed by Principia Carnivora and r/zerocarb on reddit.
