    > Let’s face it. After we lose those pounds of fat and are happy with the way we look, the main purpose of eating like this is to feel good and live long. This book helped me understand the science of heart disease and draw an important conclusion; the true answer to what causes heart disease is, “we don’t know”, but the so called “lipid hypothesis” which hypothesizes that it’s due to a high concentration of fat in your blood is hard to believe and based on weak science. Rather, cardio-vascular disease (CVD) is likely due to inflammation, caused by insulin, caused by glucose. After this book, I resolved that I will never take a statin to lower my cholesterol – ever. -/u/b-rad62

    > What an eye opener ! The books helps you understand drug studies and how they are controlled by the drug companies. This is a must read for any ketoer. Dr. Kendrick makes you realize peer review is not really a good thing all the time, when new ideas go against conventional ideas. His arguments against statins make you realize how the drug companies lie for profits. The books makes you think critically and it analyzes papers related to health and makes you realize that statistics can be twisted to support the researcher's bias. Dr. Kendrick also points out that some of the treatment for heart diseases, like stent placement and bypass surgery have not been tested properly for effectiveness.

>An extremely dense, but still somewhat accessible book about the nutrition side of cancer. The author builds on the Warburg effect and argues that cancer is not primarily caused by mutations, but by a reversal of the cell's energy production to a more primitive state. This state uses glucose and certain proteins to produce energy via fermentation instead of oxygen.
Working from this premise the author suggests fasting and a ketogenic diet to prevent cancer.
While the author's arguments were convincing, it sometimes feels he's drifting too far away from mainstream diet and I'd like to see his conclusions supported by more large studies. -/u/manu_8487

>Alright, this is not a "pro-keto" book, so I guess it can't be on the list. But I heard about if from Michael Eades's [review on his blog](https://proteinpower.com/drmike/september-2017-reading-recommendations/). The author Brady, like Eades before he retired, has a medical practice specializing in weight loss. Patients don't visit him until they've failed to lose weight repeatedly on their own. He keeps up with the science but he also knows that, no matter what the science says, if patients can't comply with a regimen, it's not very good. He has read Good Calories, Bad Calories and takes it seriously. He agrees that keto outperforms low fat but he ultimately rejects it because he has found that it creates too many noncompliance problems. This book turned me on to the [Protein Leverage Hypothesis](http://www.science20.com/deconstructing_obesity/the_protein_leverage_hypothesis-156539), which blew my mind because of its scope and explanatory power. -/u/ZooGarten

" I like to go back and re-read these articles on occasion to refresh my understanding of the Keto lifestyle. Many people aren't aware there there is a long unbroken string of professionals that have been using low carbohydrate interventions to combat obesity dating all the way back to the 1860s. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but rather shows a "lineage of thinking" that got us to where we are today. Some of these publications are hard to find now, so I leave them here for you to enjoy:

- First we have William Banting in 1862
- Then followed Vilhjalmur Stefansson
- Blake Donaldson based his Eskimo diet on Stefansson's findings: http://www.lowcarb.ca/atkins-diet-and-low-carb-plans/eskimo-diet-donaldson.html
- Donaldson's diet was cited by A.W. Pennington: http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/1/5/343.full.pdf
- And this article about Pennington was published in Holiday Magazine in 1950
- In 1958, Dr. Mackarness publishes the "Stone Age Diet": http://www.lowcarb.ca/atkins-diet-and-low-carb-plans/stone-age-diet-mackarness.html
- T.L. Cleave publishes his first paper on low carb in 1956, and then Saccarine Disease later in 1974
- Yudkin cites T.L. Cleave in his 1972 publication of "Pure, White and Deadly"
- And then, Dr. Atkins also publishes, citing the Pennington diet
