The Vegetarian Myth and the Vegan Delusion

As you may have noticed from other wiki pages - meat has a long and storied past - and it dominates the discussion when it comes to evolution, anatomy, and early doctors not influenced by pharma or dietary guidelines. But, today, meat is seen as a villain, a despised food product that should be removed, confiscated, and stopped immediately - and replaced with plant-based alternatives - usually made in factories instead of in ovens. Why has this radical change in thought occurred? Is there a bias against meat? What information prompted this swing? What forces, benign or malicious, and aligned with the human's aspiration for knowledge created these so called facts about humanity's role on planet Earth? This wiki shall attempt to expose a brief history of these events, various scientific articles showing the harms of a vegetarian or vegan diet, and then a list of sources across the internet to help substantiate these claims. 
  Right off the bat, you should know about Lierre Keith - her book _The Vegetarian Myth_ was published in 2009 and is deeply researched and often downright fascinating. It drills down into how society thinks about its consumption of plants and how farming plants has more or less destroyed the world. There is a deep and complicated cycle that involves perennial grasslands and the bugs, microbes, and animals, especially ruminants, that live there. Agriculture rips all of this away and replaces it with monocrops - and pumps fertilizer into the soil as the soil becomes a wasteland without life. Agriculture has allowed humanity to expand rapidly - but this growth has been built on a platform that requires fossil fuels and land that cannot be renewed. As Lierre Keith deconstructs the vegetarian myth, she talks about her own story as a vegan for 20 years - her declinining health, her aquired lifelong autoimmune diseases, and her slow meticulous journey from the bubble of veganism to the realization of the human need for meat. She talks of the value of low carb diets with animal products and how they can hopefully be part of a revolution in thought and practice that both vegans and carnivores can be proud of. 
    Another person to know is [Belinda Fettke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlhL-WQ_X2Y) - the wife of Orthopaedic Surgeon turned Low Carb Nutrition Advocate - Gary Fettke. Gary was attacked by the health boards of Australia when he recommended low carb diets to his patients who otherwise required surgery. His recommendations therefore reduced the number of surgeries he had to do - something to be proud of when most surgeries are amputations of diabetic limbs or arthritis from chronic dietary inflammation. Belinda ended up researching why authorities were so transfixed that animal based low carb diets were so unhealthy - and ended up discovering a long history of these attacks, many of them rooted in institutions dedicated to vegan ideals.

## Adventist Church

  > "One of the Church’s founding leaders, and certainly its most prolific writer, was Ellen G. White, who lived from 1827 until 1915. She wrote about many topics, including diet, and may be one of the most translated woman authors in history (Sanchez et al. 2016). One of her books, Ministry of Healing, includes a chapter titled “Diet and Health.” In that chapter she provides a number of recommendations. Some notable assertions include: 
* “Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our Creator” (p. 296). 
* “There is more religion in a good loaf of bread than many people think” (p. 302). 
* “A disordered stomach produces a disordered mind” (p. 310).
* “When it comes to diet, one person cannot lay down an exact rule for another” (p. 310). 

  >"A survey of Adventist religious faculty found that many considered wholism to be the church’s most important contribution to theology—more so than interpretations regarding the second advent and the seventh-day Sabbath (Bull 1990). This understanding that “a healthy mind and body directly affects one’s morals and one’s ability to discern truth” is distinct from the anthropological dualism of many Christian (Sanchez et al. 2016) as well as non-Christian faith traditions. Adventist faculty in Chile examined the social meaning of vegetarian diet, based primarily on two books: Prophetess of Health: A Study of Ellen G. White, written by historian and former Adventist, Ronald L. Numbers (1st edition 1976, 3rd edition 2008), and the SDA response, Messenger of the Lord (1998) by Herbert E. Douglass. They argued that the vegetarian diet in the 1800’s ritualized the new identity of the emerging Adventist movement and also had great symbolic meaning (Sanchez et al. 2016). For example, vegetarian diet was an important part of ‘the present truth’, that is, the message that the church was to proclaim to the world and served as a reminder to the Adventist view of world history, starting with the vegetarian diet originating in the Garden of Eden (Sanchez et al. 2016).

  >"Adventists were early adopters of medical programs on radio and cooking shows on television and have become media-savvy about spreading their health message. As of 31 December 2016, the SDA Church had 15 media centers, 59 publishing houses and branches, 6050 credentialed and licensed literature evangelists, and 25,332 full time/part time/intern literature evangelists who distribute books and other materials, including the vegetarian and health message in about 375 languages (SDA 2018). Furthermore, the Church programs aired on 853 radio stations and 441 television stations; produced more than 70,000 podcasts each year in 229 languages with over 1.1 billion downloads in 2015 (Sboros 2017).

  > "Historically, the Seventh-day Adventist Church was linked with the health sanatoriums of the ‘Christian Physiology’ movement of nineteenth century America (Nath 2010). That health reform movement was underscored by beliefs that diet was not only essential in maintaining health but also pivotal in shaping morality (Nath 2010). On a practical level, Ellen White’s vision of health reform was first operationalized in 1866 as the Western Reform Institute in Battle Creek Michigan. It combined several theories of health reform designed to heal the whole person by caring for the mind, body and spirit. Patients were taught to cure themselves whenever possible using “natural” means, including water, sunshine, exercise, rest and proper diet. To bring a more professional approach, the White’s partially subsidized the medical education of John Harvey Kellogg, the son of initial contributors to the Institute. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg served as medical director for 67 years, renaming the institute as the “Battle Creek Medical Surgical Sanitarium” (The Battle Creek Idea 2009). Dr. John Harvey Kellogg emphasized hydrotherapy (more than 200 variety of water treatments), invented several forms of light and radiant heat baths—including one installed in Buckingham Palace, developed musical accompaniments for exercise routines, and performed over 22,000 operations—and was even consulted by the Mayo brothers and other leading physicians of the day on difficult cases (The Battle Creek Idea 2009).
